## Introduction
This package allow users to do image processing on image preview and show it in real time.  
The main difference between this package and the [simple camera preview example](https://github.com/zlingkang/android_camera_preview) is that:
* It transfers image to RGB format so that user can easily do image processing with it.
* It uses the buffer way for surface view so that we do imageprocessing on the image and then show it right away in real time.

## Usage
